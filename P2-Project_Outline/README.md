## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I am creating a web application that will store calendar events for users to share. The goal is to help connect groups of people who have shared scheduling interests but no platform to do so. It's going to be a simple way to connect people and dates so that nothing gets missed. 
I plan to take this application a step further and give the users other ways to access these events. I will do this by adding email functionality that allows users to get weekly or monthly updates on their upcoming events. I am also adding a print functionality so that users can print a formatted view of their events. 

### Features
•	Create Event Form - Since the goal of the application is to make an accessible framework for storing important personal dates

•	Search (by Month or other criteria) - An input form will allow users to search for recorded events by time period or potentially other criteria (keywords, etc.).

•	List - Functionality to render a list format of events specific to a calendar based on items such as time period or potential other criteria (keywords, etc.).

•	Email (weekly or month) - Email handling to send subscribed users updates on what events are coming up on a specific calendar. Time period for this is TBD — but likely monthly.

•	Print - Create a print-friendly view that will allow individuals to easily print a formatted copy of events on a calendar over some specific view (time period, keyword, etc.).

### Technologies
•	MySQL
•	Spring Boot
•	Thymeleaf Templates
•	Bootstrap

### What I'll Have to Learn
•	Printing - Need to learn how to make a nice looking, printable page to send to a user’s printer.
•	Email a user on specific days. – How to automate emails to send on specific dates like birthdays and holidays.
•	Link info to an outside source. - How to link the information to a calendar, like Google Calendar.
